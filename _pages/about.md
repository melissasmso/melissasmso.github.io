Welcome! I’m Melissa Oliveira, a Ph.D. student in Public Policy at the Harvard Kennedy School. I also hold a B.A.H. in Political Science (minor in Feminist, Gender and Sexuality Studies) and a M.A. in Latin American Studies from Stanford University. 

During my trajectory, I have particularly focused on political economy and data science for politics, especially in what concerns gender policy. Through my honors thesis, developed under the Stanford Center for Democracy, Development and the Rule of Law, I have explored the intersections of gender, violence and political behavior in Brazil. Additionally, I have extensive research and professional experience, working in labs – such as Stanford's Poverty, Governance and Violence Lab – governments in Brazil and Mexico, and multilateral organizations like the World Bank.

You can find more about my [research](/research/), [teaching](/teaching/), and [CV](/cv/).

Thanks for visiting!
